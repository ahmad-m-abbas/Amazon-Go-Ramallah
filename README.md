## Abstract

The cashier-less revolution has taken over the market and changed the traditional shopping experience. In this paper, we discuss the challenges, design, and implementation of creating an Amazon Go-like store in Ramallah, Palestine. Employing a mixed-methods approach, we researched the design of real Amazon Go stores around the world to improve our store and make it more comfortable for customers. Our goal was not just to follow their success, but also to provide a customized store that suits our local market.
